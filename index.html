        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at
            achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and
            character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
            rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of 
            critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.
            Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student
            while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been 
            suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields. Many agree that education
            is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the 
            transmission of knowledge. But they often include other aims as well, such
            as fostering skills and character traits. However, there are deep disagreements
            about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are various ways how forms of education are
            commonly subdivided into different types. The most common subdivision is between 
            formal, non-formal, and informal education. However, some theorists only distinguish
            between formal and informal education. A process of teaching constitutes formal 
            if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually
            chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which
            have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from
            primary school to university.
